Welcome to the REAMDME.md of PeykNowruzi


Below you can see the instructions on how to interact with the program PeykNowruzi.
This program can draw your desired shapes using four characters ('/', '\\', '|', '-') on the console/cmd/terminal screen given that you've provided the corect coordinates of each character.


How to use the program:
- Run the runPeykNowruzi.exe file
- On the first line enter half of the number n of characters you want to be printed (that is to say e.g. if you want to draw n characters then you have to enter n/2).
- Now you will need to give n/2 lines of input to the program each one containing the coords (x1, y1) of the first character
and the coords (x2, y2) of the second character.
- Enter 4 numbers at each line using this format: <x1 y1 x2 y2>
- Similar formats can be used like for example: <x1    y1 x2           y2>. [Notice that entering multiple spaces or tabs won't cause any problems as long as all of the four numbers are at the same line.]
- x1 (is the x of first char) , x2 (is the x of the seocond character) etc.
- Note that at least one space or tab character should be inserted between each number in order for the program to work as expected so e.g. the following formats are invalid: <x1y1x2y2> , x1 <y1x2 y2> , etc.
- Press enter after you've typed the four numbers of each line to go to the next line
- Once you have typed the last (n/2 th) line of coords, press enter to see the result (a figure drawn on the screen).


Thanks for your cooperation!
