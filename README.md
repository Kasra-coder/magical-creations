- Run the PeykNowruzi.exe file in Windows 10 Command Prompt
- On the first line enter the number n of characters you want to be printed
- Now you will need to give n lines of input to the program each one containing the initial and final coords (x, y) of each character
- Enter 4 numbers on each line using this format: x1 y1 x2 y2
- Note that a space character should be inserted between each number in order for the program to work as expected so e.g. this format is invalid: x1y1x2y2
- Press enter after you've typed the four numbers of each line to go to the next line
- Once you you have typed the last (nth) line of coords, press enter to see the result (a figure drawn on the screen)
- Press enter again to end the program
