Welcome to the REAMDME.md of PeykNowruzi.cpp

Below you can see the instructions on how to interact with the program (PeykNowruzi.cpp).
This program can draw your desired shapes using four characters ('/', '\\', '|', '-') on the cmd screen given that you've provided the corect coordinates of each character.


How to use the program:
- Run the PeykNowruzi.exe file in Windows 10 Command Prompt
- On the first line enter the number n of characters you want to be printed
- Now you will need to give n lines of input to the program each one containing the initial and final coords (x, y) of each character
- Enter 4 numbers on each line using this format: x1 y1 x2 y2
- x1 (is the initial x) , x2 (is the final x) etc.
- Note that a space character should be inserted between each number in order for the program to work as expected so e.g. this format is invalid: x1y1x2y2
- Press enter after you've typed the four numbers of each line to go to the next line
- Once you have typed the last (nth) line of coords, press enter to see the result (a figure drawn on the screen)
- Press enter again to end the program


Thanks for your cooperation!
